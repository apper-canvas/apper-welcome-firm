      "explanation": "Most tools help with only one part of building an app. You might use one for design, another for databases, something else for login, payments, hosting, testing, & more. With Apper, everything happens in one place. The AI builds your app from start to finish: Pages and layouts, Buttons and forms, How your app behaves, Where the data goes, How users log in, How do you get paid, And more — all set up and ready to use. What truly sets Apper apart is how natural it feels. You just speak with Apper in your plain everyday language, and it understands what to build, how it should look, and how it should work. That's why Apper isn't just another app builder — it's a new way to create software.",
