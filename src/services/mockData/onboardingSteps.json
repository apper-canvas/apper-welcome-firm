      "explanation": "Apper is your AI app creator. It's not just powered by AI — it is AI. Kind of like ChatGPT, but instead of giving you answers, Apper builds fully functional apps based on your inputs in a few minutes. You don't need to write code, pick design templates, or juggle multiple tools to handle different parts of an app. With Apper, everything happens in one place, all through a simple conversation (chat interface). Just chat with Apper (in your simple, everyday English) and tell it what kind of app you need. It builds and improves your app instantly based on your chat inputs. In short, Apper is the simplest way to build complete, functional apps — just by having a conversation with AI.",

      "explanation": "Most tools help with only one part of building an app. You might use one for design, another for databases, something else for login, payments, hosting, testing, & more. With Apper, everything happens in one place. The AI builds your app from start to finish: Pages and layouts, Buttons and forms, How your app behaves, Where the data goes, How users log in, How do you get paid, And more — all set up and ready to use. What truly sets Apper apart is how natural it feels. You just speak with Apper in your plain everyday language, and it understands what to build, how it should look, and how it should work. That's why Apper isn't just another app builder — it's a new way to create software.",

For example, you could type something like: 'I want to build a tool to track customer orders.' or 'Make an app where users can book sessions and pay online.' or 'Create a quiz game that gives points and tracks team progress.' But to help Apper understand your idea more clearly, we strongly recommend refining your prompt first with ChatGPT. Here's how to do it.",
